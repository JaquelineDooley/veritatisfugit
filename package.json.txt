Comments for the package.json cause I can't put them in the file itself...

   "@types/node": "9.6.7"
   => pin the types/node dependency for a more reliable build
      example https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/25342
      @types/node is a transitive dep from typedoc, typedoc doesn't lock it
